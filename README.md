AI Model Robustness Training System Simulator

This is a web application that simulates and visualizes adaptive learning strategies (Adaptive Adversarial Training) to improve the robustness of AI models. 

It provides an intuitive look into the complex process of actual AI model training, helping users easily understand the principles and effectiveness of robustness training. ​

## Key Features ​Dynamic Simulation
Simulates the training process based on user-defined parameters (epochs, datasets, attack methods, etc.). ​

## Adaptive Learning Strategy
Periodically calculates the model's vulnerability and dynamically adjusts the types and proportions of adversarial samples used in training. 

## ​Real-time Visualization: 
Displays the accuracy, loss, and attack-specific vulnerability (\pi) of both a standard model and a robustness-trained model in real time on a graph. ​

## Final Performance Analysis 
After training is complete, it compares the final performance of the two models using a bar chart and provides a detailed analysis of the robustness-trained model's performance. 

## Diverse Attack Methods
Includes various adversarial attack techniques like FGSM, PGD, HopSkipJump, and CW, allowing users to combine them as they wish.
